DONATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  

1) Created project and app-UserManagement 
2) Basic setup like app registration, url configuration,middlewares
3) Created User Model-CustomUser and used for 'AUTH_USER_MODEL' in settings.py
4) static file setup as globally
5) In 'UserManagement':
    a) Views
        i)    Created Login,Registration and Dashboard class based view
        ii)   Login and Registration both are form based views and have form_valid and form_invalid to create,authenticate and check errors
    b) Forms
        i)   Login and Registration form
        ii)  Login form has just two fields 
        iii) Registration form is 'modelForm' with required fields,labels and widgets defined  
        iv)  Override 'save()' function to hash password before saving object
    c) Admin
        --> Since "CustomUser" is made from "AbstractUser" , we defined new admin class inherited from "admin.ModelAdmin that has "form = Registration" to help admin to not be overwhelmed.
        --> Admin now only has to fill "Registration" form to create user in admin page. 
    

[ Note: Always migrate after user model defined in settings.py and re-define username and email so no foreign key contraints error occur ]
